# Arduino Connect
This project was made in 2nd semester.<br>
The project uses an Android phone to drive a Car(Arduino connected with motors) or a bot if you prefer that way :p

## If you want to run the project as is, do the following steps - 
1. The [code](sketch_apr15b.ino) for Arduino needs to be uploaded in a suitable Arduino Board, I used Arduino Uno. 
You can check for the pins in the file, lmotor means left motor forward terminal, whereas lbmotor would mean it's other terminal.
Similar goes for right-motor. _(I used the concept of differential driving to drive the bot with only 2 motors connects parallelly)_
2. The android [app](ArduinoConnect.apk) is accompanied, but if you want you can also buid it yourself from the [compressed file](IP-master.zip) or from [here](https://github.com/Shivamsg?tab=repositories).
3. The hardware requirements are - Arduino(Uno), Bluetooth module(HC-05), Jumper wires, Motor Driver(L293D) preferably, 9V batteries to power the Board as well as 2 motors, a chasis, an Android Phone and a little common sense to hook everything up.
